# MusicLibrary


I have uploaded 2 of the files that make up the entire program. These were the two files (almost) entirely coded by me. 
Whenever it says ADD CODE HERE, it is exactly where I had to add all of my code. 

MYHASHTABLE : this file creates a HashTable from scratchwith its respective methods (put, get, remove, getValues, getKeys, rehash, 
Hash Iterator). 

MUSICSTORE : implementing the code from the HashTable file, this code allows you to add a song to the Library, organizing it by author, title and year
(in 3 different HashTables). You can also search the Libraryâ€™s content by title, artist, or year. 

There are comments on both files explaining what each method does.
